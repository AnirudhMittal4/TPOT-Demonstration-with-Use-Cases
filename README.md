TPOT will automate the most tedious part of machine learning by intelligently exploring thousands of possible pipelines to find the best one for your data

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a way of programming a computer to learn to do a task on its own rather than you having to explicitly tell it how to accomplish the task 

Common machine learning tasks are:
1. Classification (Hot dog or Not hot dog)
2. Regression (Predicting stock returns

## Introducing TPOT

TPOT will automate the most tedious part of machine learning by intelligently exploring thousands of possible pipelines to find the best one for your data

TPOT uses Genetic Programming to select the best machine learning model and optimize parameters

Best of all, TPOT is a free Python package


## Benefits of TPOT

Time Saver

Feasibility - Smell Test

Parameter Optimization
